# Luminance and Soil Test
This is a basic test. Here we introduce the following programming concepts:

* If
* && Boolean Operator
* >= and > Operators
* Functions (setColor)
* Last Function Call Wins (i.e. if setColor called twice in one loop, the first ones are ignored)
* Delay Function (1000ms means 1 second delay)
* Comments

We also introduce the luminance sensor which senses the light and the soil sensor which senses
the soil temperature and the soil humidity.
